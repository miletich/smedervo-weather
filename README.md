# Weather Data Visualisation

D3.js + React Server Components = Works with JS disabled.

Demo: [https://smedervo-weather.vercel.app/](https://smedervo-weather.vercel.app/).

## The Point

- Ship a meaningful data visualisation in the initial HTML that works even with JS disabled in the browser.
- Only use Client Components when absolutely necessary.
- Ship as little D3.js code as possible to the client.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
